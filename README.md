# Grasp AI

Learn AI-assisted development progressively.

## Levels

| Branch | What you learn |
|--------|----------------|
| `level-0` | Naive chat usage |
| `level-1` | Reusable prompt templates |
| `level-2` | Context injection (CLAUDE.md) |
| `level-3` | Custom commands + commit/PR |
| `level-4` | /explain skill + notes |
| `level-5` | /review spaced repetition |

## Quick start

```bash
# Checkout the level you want to learn
git checkout level-1

# Read the README changes for that level
```

## Philosophy

- Less is more
- Learn by doing, not reading
- Trust but verify AI output
